This repository contains a Jupyter notebook presenting some background on single particle tracking (SPT) in cells, using as a support interactive simulations of random Brownian motion of microparticles. This material is aimed at an audience with a biological background and was originally developed for the Block Course of Spring 2021 at the Institute of Biochemistry, ETH Zürich, Switzerland, by:
* [Margit Peaudecerf](https://bc.biol.ethz.ch/research/weis/People2020/margit-peaudecerf.html)
* [François Peaudecerf](https://n.ethz.ch/~fpeaudec/)
